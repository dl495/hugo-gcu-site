    <p>If you&rsquo;re coming to Cambridge in October, then congratulations! We&rsquo;re really excited for the start of next term, and hopefully you are too. Please do <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> - we&rsquo;d really love to hear from you. If you have any questions at all, just send us an email and we&rsquo;ll get back to you!{{ partial "freshersfacebook.html" . }}

    <h2 id="toc_1">Getaway</h2>

    <p>We&rsquo;ll be meeting together as a college group before the start of first term.  This is a great chance to meet some Christians in college before Freshers&rsquo; Week starts, plus it will be great fun! Freshers are especially welcome! If you&rsquo;d like to know more, just <a href="/contact">send us an email</a> and we&rsquo;ll tell you everything you need to know. Whilst you wait for our reply, you can find some information <a href="/getaway">here<a>.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_2">Church Breakfasts</h2>

    <p>At the start of term, we put on a free breakfast on Sunday mornings before heading off to church. There are lots of great churches in Cambridge, so we hope that coming to breakfast and hearing a bit about each church should make it much easier to find a church you like! We'll be meeting from 9am on 4th and 11th October in Old Kitchens (follow the signs!) and we'd love to see you there.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about churches in Cambridge, or just want to know a bit more, then <a href="/contact">let us know</a>.</p>
