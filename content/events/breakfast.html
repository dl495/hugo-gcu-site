<h2 id="toc_2">Church Breakfasts</h2>

<p>At the start of term, we'll be putting on a free breakfast on the first few Sunday mornings before heading off to church. There are lots of great churches in Cambridge, so we hope that coming to breakfast and hearing a bit about each church should make it much easier to find a church you like! We'll be meeting from 9am on 4th and 11th October in Old Kitchens (follow the signs!) and we'd love to see you there.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about churches in Cambridge, or just want to know a bit more, then <a href="/contact">let us know</a>.</p>
