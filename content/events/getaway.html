<!-- <h2>Freshers&rsquo; Getaway</h2>

  <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this as a fresher preparing to come to college this October and can&rsquo;t wait to get stuck into CU when you arrive, then we&rsquo;ve got just the opportunity for you! You are warmly invited to CICCU&rsquo;s Freshers&rsquo; Getaway in Herefordshire before the start of term from 24th - 26th September.</p>

  <p>All the information you should need to know about it can be found <a href="http://ciccu.org.uk/freshers/" target="_blank">here</a> -->



<h2 id="toc_0">Pre-Term Team Day</h2>

  <br><p>On Monday 28th September, just before International Freshers&rsquo; Week, the CUs of Sidney Sussex, Corpus Christi and St. Catharine&rsquo;s Colleges will be joining GCU for a day of summer catch-up, gospel teaching, worship, games and much cake in the Stanley Library at Girton College (so maybe &ldquo;Getaway&rdquo; is pushing it a bit...).</p>

  <p>We'd love this to be a day where as much of our community can come together to prepare to open our arms to all the new faces who will be coming to our college in the following week. So please sign up using the form below as soon as you can. If you need help with arranging early arrival, <a href="mailto:{{.Site.Params.JointRepEmail}}">give us a shout</a>.</p>
